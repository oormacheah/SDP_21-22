asynchronous I/O refers to not performing I/O operations in a blocking manner.
Sync IO can be very time expensive, because they depend on the hardware technology and the size of elements
to read/write. There are 2 main strategies on async. I/O.
1) Multi-threaded I/O consists of performing synchronous (i.e. blocking) IO operations in parallel assigning
several threads a different portion of the file to process.
2) asynchronous I/O is performed in UNIX systems through AIO control block structure. It allows the programmer
to define multiple parameters of the operation that is not meant to be blocking on its own. It will define the 
standard parameters of an IO operation (number of bytes, file descriptor, offset, etc.) and also provides
information about how will the aio_read/write caller be notified about the completion of the operation. It is
usually done through UNIX signals.
